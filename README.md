# Sonic Nexus Plus v5
This is the Summer 2008 Demo of [Sonic Nexus](https://info.sonicretro.org/Sonic_Nexus) made by Taxman, now expanded with the power of RSDKv5.

This is a enhanced and expanded direct port of the game, using the RSDKv5 port by [MegAmi24](https://github.com/MegAmi24/Sonic-Nexus-v5).

# How to Build

## Get the source code
First, you will need to clone the repository containing the source code. To do this, you need to install Git, which you can find [here](https://git-scm.com/downloads).

Clone the repo **recursively**, using:
`git clone https://github.com/BlueSpeedsterYT/Sonic-Nexus-Plus-v5 --recursive`

If you've already cloned the repo, run these commands inside of the repository to ensure the clone is up-to-date:
```
git pull
git submodule update --remote --init --recursive
```

## Building

### Building with CMake
No external dependencies are required; simply type the following commands in the `Source` folder in the repository:
```
cmake -B build
cmake --build build --config release
```

The resulting build will be located somewhere in `build/` depending on your system.

The following CMake arguments are available when compiling:
- Use these on the `cmake -B build` step like so: `cmake -B build -DRETRO_REVISION=2`

#### Sonic Nexus v5 flags
- `RETRO_REVISION`: What RSDKv5 revision to compile for. Takes an integer, defaults to `3` (RSDKv5U).
- `RETRO_MOD_LOADER_VER`: Manually sets the mod loader version. Takes an integer, defaults to the current latest version.
- `GAME_INCLUDE_EDITOR`: Whether or not to include functions for use in certain RSDKv5 scene editors. Takes a boolean, defaults to `on`.

### Building in Visual Studio
Simply open the solution in the `Source` folder and build the project. Make sure that the architecture, engine revision, and mod loader version match with the target engine binary.

### Building for Android
After [setting up the RSDKv5(U) decompilation for building](https://github.com/Rubberduckycooly/RSDKv5-Decompilation#how-to-build), you will need to add a symbolic link for the directory to the repository so that the game will be built as part of the APK.
To add the symlink, write the appropriate command in `[RSDKv5-decompilation-root]/android/app/jni`:
  * Windows: `mklink /d Game "[path-to-game-repo]/Source"`
  * Linux: `ln -s "[path-to-game-repo]/Source" Game`

After adding the symlink, build the RSDKv5(U) decompilation in Android Studio.
